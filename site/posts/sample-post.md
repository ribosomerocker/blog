# Hello, World!

This is my first post. I am a programmer who's interested in the theoretical basis and how that could improve programming in practice. One of my favourite programming languages is Haskell. 

The name of this website is called "denotation" for a reason. It's mainly got to do with denotational semantics, which to my understanding is linking a snippet of code to it's canonical mathematical abstraction, which I absolutely love. Writing code in hopes of keeping it as denotational as possible allows us to reuse more code and for details to be clearer.


## How is this website hosted?

I use Cloudflare Pages for hosting and the beautiful domain name, and I use Haskell and Slick to generate it. I would say something like "It seems to be going well so far", but I'm writing this post without ever trying to run it. In fact, I am writing this post *to* run it. Wish me luck!
